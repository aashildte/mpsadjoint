This code repository is developed as a part of an existing research project estimating active tension in cardiac micromuscles. Solving an inverse problem, formulated as a PDE-constrained minimization problem, we find a spatial-temoral distribution of active tension and a spatial distribution of the fiber angle for any selected sample.
